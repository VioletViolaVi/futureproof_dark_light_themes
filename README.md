# Futureproof Dark Light Themes

This project is based on the creation of a website where the user can change its background theme. It was assigned by Futureproof. It uses HTML5 & CSS3 to create the static look. It uses JavaScript to toggle between the themes. Unsplash was used to add an image for the favicon.
